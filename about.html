	<h1>Message From The Principal</h1>
		<br>
		<p>"Dear Prospective Students,

Trinity International College celebrated 10 years of academic excellence. Throughout these ten twenty years, Aristotle’s quotation on “making excellence a habit” has inspired all of us in the college to achieve excellence in whatever we do in the college. 
</p>
		<p>
Our first priority is academic excellence. We can proudly state that we have achieved this through student-oriented teaching, close monitoring of the students’ attendance and performance, regular tests, assessments and examinations, providing necessary counseling and remedial classes in a very caring environment. From the very first year of our operations in 2008, our focus on academic excellence in a caring environment has translated into the college being consistently ranked amongst the top +2 institution in the country. From 2010 onwards, our results have been outstanding, with our students securing 100% results in both science and commerce over two consecutive years. Not satisfied with this, we have improved further our teaching-learning and significantly improved all our facilities to become one of the best if not the best +2 institution in the country. We invite students to be a part of this challenging and exciting journey."</p><br><br>
